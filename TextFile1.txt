Issues/Problems to solve

1. Names of parties has to be consistent
	-Recommendation: make an overall client area to be in. This way you can minimize the amount of loans that you are looking at. 
	
	>Enter client space
	>Client can enter a list of parties that will be used if they know some (optional)
	>Client has drop down list of parties he can enter, but can also enter new parties
	>There should be an option to remove old parties but disclaimer it will mess with things. 

2. Loans must be organized and separated by a script
	-Will begin with original_agreement date
	-If matches will then focus on parties
	-If matches will focus on principal amounts
	-also look into option of loan agreement 1 (titles of some sort)
	-Year will be a factor when making these scripts as some are relevant and some are not
